				the &#8220;<span class="quote">fruit of the vine</span>&#8221;, or in their culture, the wine.</p></li><li><p>At the end of the meal, Jesus shared &#8220;<span class="quote">fruit of the vine</span>&#8221;
				<span class="emphasis"><em>again,</em></span> immediately before he began the time of
				teaching.</p></li></ul></div><p>Since wine is the sort of beverage that one sips, rather than guzzling down
		a glass all at once, the reasonable expectation is that Jesus had them share the
		wine at the beginning of the meal, they sipped it throughout, and then he
		offered them a refill, as it were, to begin the time of teaching.</p><p>But Jesus didn't stop there, the second time he divided the wine, Jesus
		did two things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>He identified the wine with the new covenant in his own blood.</p></li><li><p>Just as he had with the bread, he commanded the disciples to
				&#8220;<span class="quote">Do this in remembrance of me.</span>&#8221;</p></li></ul></div><p>What did Jesus want the believers to do in remembrance of him?  The wine had
		been shared throughout a full meal and the time of teaching afterward.  Was that the 
		context that Jesus intended or was he simply referring to the elements of he bread 
		and the wine when he told us to &#8220;<span class="quote">Do this in remembrance of me</span>&#8221;?</p><p>One hint to the answer lies in comparing Matthew's and Luke's accounts of
		the Last Supper.  Matthew describes Jesus sharing the wine a single time, and
		associated with this, saying "I will not drink of the fruit of the vine again 
		until the Kingdom of God comes" (what Jesus said the <span class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span>
		time), and "The cup that is poured out is the new covenant in my blood" (what
		Jesus said the <span class="emphasis"><em>second</em></span> time he shared the cup.  So, to 
		Matthew, it seems that the sharing of the cup encompassed both the meal, and 
		the time of teaching afterward.</p><p>What about the rest of Scripture?  Can we be reasonably sure that this
		understanding is accurate?</p><p>The easiest way to answer this question is to ask how the disciples themselves
		understood Jesus.  We are separated from him by around 2000 years, by language, by culture,
		etc.</p><p>But the disciples and early apostles had none of these impediments.  They were
		ideally situated to understand exactly what Jesus intended.</p><p>That will be the topic of our next study.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="chapter_harmony_with_corinthians"></a>3.&nbsp;&#8220;<span class="quote">Proclaim the Lord&#8217;s death until he comes</span>&#8221;</h2></div></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="epigraph"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&#8220;Do this in remembrance of me.&#8221;  ....

				</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"><p>When we line up the topics covered by Paul next to those covered by Jesus during the Last 
		Supper, one thing immediately jumps out at us: both Jesus and Paul used a <span class="emphasis"><em>similar 
		sequence</em></span> of events.</p><p>The difference between the two is that the Last Supper was an actual full meal followed 
		by a time of teaching led by Jesus, the head of the spiritual household of faith.  Paul, on 
		the other hand, instructs the Corinthians in <span class="emphasis"><em>how to continue having a gathering of 
		this sort</em></span>&#8212;a full meal together that honors Jesus, followed by a time of 
		teaching where Jesus, the Head, still gets to lead via the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Is this correspondance a coincidence?</p><p>This servant of the Lord finds it hard to believe that this is a coincidence.  It seems that
		Paul intentionally followed the form that Jesus had initiated when he had said, <span class="emphasis"><em>
		&#8220;<span class="quote">do this in rememberance of me.</span>&#8221;</em></span>  And if that weren't enough, Paul ends 
		his teaching with the following:
		
		</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>
			14:37 If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, he should acknowledge 
			that what I write to you is the Lord&#8217;s command. 14:38 If someone does not recognize this, he is 
			not recognized. (NET)

		the vine.  Paul told the Corinthians how to hold a full meal in honor of Jesus that includes
		sharing the bread and the fruit of the vine.</p><p>After supper, Jesus poured each disciple a second helping of the fruit of the vine, 
		forshadowing the gifts of the Holy Spirit enabling each disciple to hear him individually.  
		Then he gave a teaching to the entire body of disciples.  Similarly, Paul described how Jesus, 
		through the gifts of the Holy Spirit operating in love, desires to speak through each 
		individual in a particular way, so that when put together, the entire Body would be able 
		to hear and understand Jesus teaching them.</p><p>These two things were the essential ingredients for Jesus.  And they were the essential
		ingredients for Paul.  For Jesus, having these things was <span class="emphasis"><em>both necessary and also 
		sufficient.</em></span>  The same was true for Paul.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
