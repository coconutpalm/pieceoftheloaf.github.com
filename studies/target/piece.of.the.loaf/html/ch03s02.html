		the vine.  Paul told the Corinthians how to hold a full meal in honor of Jesus that includes
		sharing the bread and the fruit of the vine.</p><p>After supper, Jesus poured each disciple a second helping of the fruit of the vine, 
		forshadowing the gifts of the Holy Spirit enabling each disciple to hear him individually.  
		Then he gave a teaching to the entire body of disciples.  Similarly, Paul described how Jesus, 
		through the gifts of the Holy Spirit operating in love, desires to speak through each 
		individual in a particular way, so that when put together, the entire Body would be able 
		to hear and understand Jesus teaching them.</p><p>These two things were the essential ingredients for Jesus.  And they were the essential
		ingredients for Paul.  For Jesus, having these things was <span class="emphasis"><em>both necessary and also 
		sufficient.</em></span>  The same was true for Paul.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">3.&nbsp;&#8220;<span class="quote">Proclaim the Lord&#8217;s death until he comes</span>&#8221;&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
