    Zechariah had asked.</p><p>Zechariah had just asked for a child. And God had provided 
    much more than any child. God promised a son who would carry 
    Israel's spiritual inheritance forward. Who would turn 
    Israel's hearts back to a <span class="emphasis"><em>relationship with 
    God.</em></span> They needed to be prepared because they were living 
    in the time just before Jesus, Immanuel, God With Us was about to 
    come.</p><p>Naturally, the Lord was concerned with the material blessing. 
    A flesh-and-blood son would carry forward Zechariah's family 
    inheritance and take away his social stigma from being 
    childless.</p><p>But the Lord was far more concerned with who this son would 
    be spiritually:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>What would he do?</p></li><li><p>How would he live?</p></li><li><p>What would his life mean?</p></li><li><p>What spiritual inheritance, what spiritual legacy would 
        he leave?</p></li></ul></div><p>This entire experience of having no son had been a great 
    difficulty for Zechariah. But God was about to turn 
    Zechariah's difficulty into an answer for all of God's 
    people's needs.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&#8220;<span class="quote">Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your
