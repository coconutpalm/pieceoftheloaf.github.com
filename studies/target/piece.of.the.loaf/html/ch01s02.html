		for all of them.  And then he sat down to eat the Passover with them.</p><p>But God had spoken through Moses that "each must take a lamb for themselves according 
		to their families"  Thus, according to the Law of Moses, Jesus should have dismissed his
		disciples to all go to their families and celebrate Passover with them, and then
		to gather back together again later.</p><p>But he didn't, because rather than fulfilling the Law according to the flesh, Jesus
		was going to fulfil the Law according to the Spirit, in a prophetic or symbolic sense.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>God had told the people of Israel through Moses to "take a lamb according to

				Lamb of God.</p></li></ul></div><p>The result is that what Jesus did was completely appropriate according to the Law of the
		Spirit of life.</p><p>On the Passover day, the Lamb had to be killed and eaten.  Symbolically Jesus 
		fulfilled this also.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="epigraph"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it,

		Jesus promises to be present today too (Matthew 18:20).</p><p>Today we again have God's family assembled.  And we have the Lamb.  
		We have the supper.  And today, Jesus invites us to break the bread and share
