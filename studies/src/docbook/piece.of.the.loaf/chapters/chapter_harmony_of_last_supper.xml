	<para>What did Jesus want us to do in remembrance of him?  What are the implications of this for
	our understanding of the Body of Christ?  In order to really understand this,
	we must first look at exactly what Jesus and the disciples did that last supper.  Then we need
	to ask, <quote>What did the early disciples understand Jesus to mean?</quote></para>
	
	<para>The following	outline describes what happened, and was produced simply by harmonizing 
	what all of the Gospels and 1 Corinthians say about the Last Supper.</para>

		<title>The Last Supper &mdash; A family meal</title>
		
		<para>As we look at the outline above, a few things should immediately strike us:</para>
		
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Broadly speaking, what we have is a picture or a description of a
				<emphasis>family meal</emphasis>, followed by a time of teaching by the
				<emphasis>head of the house</emphasis>.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>This happened on the occasion of a Passover meal, yet, none of the details 
				of a Passover meal itself are described.  The meal description itself is
				generic.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>From the perspective of the disciples, the time of teaching was 
				<emphasis>unplanned</emphasis> and <emphasis>spontaneous</emphasis>.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		
		<para>When we look at this sequence of events a bit more closely, a few other
		things might strike us:</para>
		
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>At the beginning of the meal, Jesus invited the disciples to share
				the <quote>fruit of the vine</quote>, or in their culture, the wine.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>At the end of the meal, Jesus shared <quote>fruit of the vine</quote>
				<emphasis>again,</emphasis> immediately before he began the time of
				teaching.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		
		<para>Since wine is the sort of beverage that one sips, rather than guzzling down
		a glass all at once, the reasonable expectation is that Jesus had them share the
		wine at the beginning of the meal, they sipped it throughout, and then he
		offered them a refill, as it were, to begin the time of teaching.</para>
		
		<para>But Jesus didn't stop there, the second time he divided the wine, Jesus
		did two things:</para>
		
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>He identified the wine with the new covenant in his own blood.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Just as he had with the bread, he commanded the disciples to
				<quote>Do this in remembrance of me.</quote></para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>What did Jesus want the believers to do in remembrance of him?  The wine had
		been shared throughout a full meal.  Was that the context that Jesus intended or was
		he simply referring to the elements of he bread and the wine when he told us to
		<quote>Do this in remembrance of me</quote>?</para>
		
		<para>The easiest way to answer this question is to ask how the disciples themselves
		understood Jesus.  We are separated from him by around 2000 years, by language, by culture,
		etc.  But the disciples and early apostles had none of these impediments.</para>
