	<para>In this chapter, we will continue asking "What does Jesus want us to do in remembrance
	of him?"  In <xref linkend="chapter_harmony_of_last_supper"/>, Matthew gave us a hint about 
	this by identifying the "cup" as an event that spanned the entire meal and time of teaching
	afterward.  Here, we will ask, "Does comparing what happened the night Jesus was betrayed
	with Paul's instruction to the Corinthians help us understand better?"</para>

		<title>Comparison to Paul's description of a church meeting</title>
		
		<para>In Paul's epistle to the Corinthians, Paul is addressing various problems in the
		Corinthian church, and as a result, describes how he wanted their meeting to be run.
		Let's outline the topics that Paul covers when he discusses what to do
		<quote>When you come together</quote> in 1 Corinthians 11-14 in comparison with the
		events of the Last Supper and see how they line up:</para>

		<para>When we line up the topics covered by Paul next to those covered by Jesus during the Last 
		Supper, one thing immediately jumps out at us: both Jesus and Paul used a <emphasis>similar 
		sequence</emphasis> of events.</para>
		
		<para>The Last Supper was a full meal followed by a time of teaching led by Jesus, the head of the
		spiritual household of faith.  Paul instructs the Corinthians in how to have a full meal together
		that honors Jesus, followed by a time of teaching where Jesus, the Head, still gets to lead via the
		gifts of the Holy Spirit.</para>
		
		<para>Is this correspondance a coincidence?</para>
		
		<para>This servant of the Lord finds it hard to believe that this is a coincidence.  It seems that
		Paul intentionally followed the form that Jesus had initiated when he had said, <emphasis>
		<quote>do this in rememberance of me.</quote></emphasis>  And if that weren't enough, Paul ends 
		his teaching with the following:
		
		<blockquote><para><emphasis>
			14:37 If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, he should acknowledge 
			that what I write to you is the Lord’s command. 14:38 If someone does not recognize this, he is 
			not recognized. &net;
		</emphasis></para></blockquote></para>

		<title>Conclusion</title>
		
		<para>Jesus had a full meal with the disciples during which he shared the bread and fruit of
		the vine.  Paul told the Corinthians how to hold a full meal in honor of Jesus that includes
		sharing the bread and the fruit of the vine.</para>
		
		<para>After supper, Jesus poured each disciple a second helping of the fruit of the vine, 
		forshadowing the gifts of the Holy Spirit enabling each disciple to hear him individually.  
		Then he gave a teaching to the entire body of disciples.  Similarly, Paul described how Jesus, 
		through the gifts of the Holy Spirit operating in love, desires to speak through each 
		individual in a particular way, so that when put together, the entire Body would be able 
		to hear and understand Jesus teaching them.</para>
		
		<para>These two things were the essential ingredients for Jesus.  And they were the essential
		ingredients for Paul.  For Jesus, having these things was <emphasis>both necessary and also 
		sufficient.</emphasis>  The same was true for Paul.</para>
