		<title>When you come together</title>
		<partintro>
			<para>The Last Supper.  The very mentioning of this term puts images in our hearts
			and minds that may or may not match what actually happened in Scripture.  So, what exactly
			happened?  Let's dive into Scripture and ask that question.  What we find might surprise,
			amaze, or even offend.  But in order to be faithful to God's revelation in his Word,
			we really must ask, must we not?
			
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para><xref linkend="chapter_harmony_of_last_supper" /> &mdash; simply reconstructs
					in outline form exactly what happened that first night Jesus met with his 
					disciples, and asks a crucial question: <quote>If Jesus invited us to do this
					in remembrance of him and Paul adds that by doing this we proclaim our Lord's
					death until he comes, is there any good reason not to do just that?</quote>.</para>

		<title>The Measure of Christ's Stature</title>
		
		<partintro>
			<para>In <xref linkend="preface"/>, we motivated this series by noticing how the practice of
			assembling together in the early church was done according to a pattern that Jesus initiated
			and that Paul further detailed.  But before we can understand why our Lord would have instituted
			this pattern, we first need to understand, <quote>What is the Body of Christ?</quote>
