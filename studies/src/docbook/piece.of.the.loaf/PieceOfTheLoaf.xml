		<title>When you come together</title>
		<partintro>
			<para>The Last Supper.  The very mentioning of this term puts images in our hearts
			and minds that may or may not match what actually happened in Scripture.  So, what exactly
			happened?  And what does this imply about how we can practice our faith?  Let's dive 
			into Scripture and ask that question.
			
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para><xref linkend="chapter-last-supper-family-of-God"/> &mdash; describes how
					Jesus broke the Law when he celebrated the Passover containing the Last Supper.
					Or did he?</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para><xref linkend="chapter_harmony_of_last_supper" /> &mdash; asks a simple question:
					"What did Jesus want us to do in remembrance of him?" and begins to answer the
					question by harmonizing all of the accounts of the Last Supper.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para><xref linkend="chapter_harmony_with_corinthians" /> &mdash; continues asking
					"What did Jesus want us to do in remembrance of him?" by comparing the events of the
					Last Supper with Paul's "when you come together" discourse in 1 Corinthians 11-14.
					We are separated from Jesus by some 2000 years, Paul by somewhat less than that.
					Does Paul's teaching help us understand any better what Jesus meant?</para>

		<title>Luke/Acts</title>
		
		<partintro>
			<para>Luke/Acts chronicles the start of the Church. Both are written
			to <quote>Theophilus</quote>, who might have been a real man but
			whose name means <quote>lover of God</quote>.  The purpose in
			Luke&apos;s Gospel is <quote>so that you may know for certain the
			things you were taught.</quote></para>

			<para>Luke&apos;s Gospel is the story of Jesus&apos;s life in the
			flesh, from the sign of John the Baptist (whose job was to prepare
			the way for Jesus to come the first time), until Jesus himself was
			raised from the dead and taken into heaven.</para>

			<para>The thrust of Acts is the story of Jesus&apos; life through the
			<emphasis>church,</emphasis> (whose job is to prepare the way for
			Jesus to return) until the Body of Christ brought the Gospel all 
			the way to Rome, and even to the very palace of the emperor.</para>
			
			<para>This series studies through Luke/Acts, asking the question,
			What is the Holy Spirit trying to tell us about God's plan for
			the Church to multiply?
			
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para><xref linkend="chapter-jbaptist_birth" /> &mdash;
					After Luke's prolog, he starts his Gospel with a lesson on
					prayer.  In this story, Zechariah illustrates how God
					takes the small, imperfect things that we offer and makes them
					into much more--far more than we could imagine.  And he
					transforms our lives and the lives of others around us in the 
					process.</para>
