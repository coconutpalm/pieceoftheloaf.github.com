\beginscripture{Ephesians 2:4-7 (NET)}
But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us, 
even though we were dead in transgressions, made us alive together with Christ -- by grace you are saved! -- 
and he raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 
to demonstrate in the coming ages the surpassing wealth of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
