\beginscripture{Isaiah 53:3-5 (NET)}
\Acolon He was despised and rejected by people,
\Acolon one who experienced pain and was acquainted with illness;
\Acolon people hid their faces from him;
\Acolon he was despised, and we considered him insignificant.
\Acolon But he lifted up our illnesses,
\Acolon he carried our pain;
\Acolon even though we thought he was being punished,
\Acolon attacked by God, and afflicted for something he had done.
\Acolon He was wounded because of our rebellious deeds,
\Acolon crushed because of our sins;
\Acolon he endured punishment that made us well;
\Acolon because of his wounds we have been healed.
