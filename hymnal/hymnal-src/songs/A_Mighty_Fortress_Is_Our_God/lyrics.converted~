\beginverse
  Did we in our own strength confide,
Our striving would be losing;
Were not the right man on our side,
The man of God’s own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be? 
Christ Jesus— it is he,
Lord Sabaoth his name,
From age to age the same,
And he must win the battle.
\endverse
\beginverse
  That word above all earthly pow’rs, —
No thanks to them, abideth.
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go,
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill,
God’s truth abideth still:
His kingdom is forever.
