II. System Requirements

In order to install and run this software, you will need:

1. a C compiler (by default, the installation attempts to use "cc"),
2. a LaTeX2e installation (by default, the installation tries "pdflatex"),
3. tar and gunzip programs (to unpack the songs-x.xx.tar.gz file), and
4. an installation of GNU Make (to run the Makefile).


III. Installation Instructions

1. Unpack the songs-x.xx.tar.gz file (where x.xx is the version number).

     gunzip songs-x.xx.tar.gz
     tar -xof songs-x.xx.tar

2. Change directory to the songs directory and run the configure script.

     cd songs
     ./configure

3. Run GNU make (other versions of make are not supported).  On many systems
the system "make" command is linked to GNU make.  If your version of make is
not GNU-compatible you will get an error message suggesting you try "gmake"
or "gnumake" instead of "make".

     gmake

4. To install LaTeX package files and Vim support files in the appropriate
places on your system, make the "install" target.  (This step is not necessary
for single-user use of the software.) You can dictate which directories in
which to install files by defining any or all of the following variables on
the gmake command-line:

     bindir -       directory for songidx and sbdchk executables
                      (e.g., "/usr/local/bin" or "~/bin")
     datadir -      directory for .can data files (required for songidx)
                      (e.g., "/usr/local/share" or "~/data")
     texmfpath -    TeX root directory where style files are installed
                      (e.g., "/usr/share/texmf" or "~/localtexmf")
     docdir -       directory where documentation should be installed
                      (e.g., "/usr/local/share/doc/songs" or "~/doc/songs")
     vimfilespath - directory where vim support files are installed
                      (e.g., "/usr/share/vim/vimfiles" or "~/.vim")

For example, a typical single-user installation might use:

     gmake install bindir=~/bin datadir=~/data texmfpath=~/localtexmf
                   docdir=~/doc/songs vimfilespath=~/.vim

Alternatively, you can manually install the relevant files by copying them
to the appropriate locations on your system.  For example:

     cp src/songidx/songidx src/sbdchk/sbdchk ~/bin
     mkdir ~/data/songs
     cp src/songidx/*.can src/sbdchk/hyphdict.tex ~/data/songs
     mkdir ~/localtexmf/tex/latex/songs
     cp src/songs/songs.sty ~/localtexmf/tex/latex/songs
     mkdir ~/doc/songs
     cp src/songs/songs.pdf ~/doc/songs
     cp -r src/vim ~/.vim


IV. Usage

Running "gmake" will generate three clusters of files:

A. LaTeX Package Style File and Documentation

In songs/src/songs you will find:
* src/songs/songs.sty: If you don't use "gmake install" to install this LaTeX
  style file in the system's TeX repository tree then songs.sty must be copied
  into each directory that has a .tex file that uses the songs package.
* src/songs/songs.pdf: This file fully documents the songs package and all of
  its features.  To generate documentation as a .dvi or .ps file instead, use
  "gmake dvi" or "gmake ps".

B. Sample Song Books

The GNUmakefile in songs/sample generates the sample song books.  There are
four books in total:
* sample/chordbook.pdf: a chord book for musicians,
* sample/lyricbook.pdf: a lyric book for singers,
* sample/slidebook.pdf: a book of slides for use with a digital projector, and
* sample/transparencies.pdf: book of transparencies for an overhead projector.
All four books draw upon the song data contained in the file songs.sbd.  By
modifying that file, you can change the content of all four books.  To change
the formatting style of any particular book, change the corresponding
sample/*.tex file.

You can create a new song book directory by copying the sample directory and
its contents to a new subdirectory:

     cp -r sample mybook
     cd mybook
     gmake

C. Support Utilities (songidx and sbdchk)

* songs/src/songidx/songidx: This program is required for auto-generating song
  book indexes.  The GNUmakefile in songs/sample invokes it automatically as
  necessary.
* songs/src/sbdchk/sbdchk: The sbdchk program is a utility that proofs .sbd
  files for chord placement errors.  Chords are misplaced if they fall at an
  invalid hyphenation point or they break a ligature.  To use the sbdchk
  utility with the sample song books, change to the songs/sample directory and
  type

     gmake sbdcheck

  This will generate a report file named songs.hyp in the current directory.


V. Removal / Reinstallation

To reverse the behavior of "make install", type:

     gmake uninstall

To merely delete all generated files within the songs directory, type:

     gmake clean
